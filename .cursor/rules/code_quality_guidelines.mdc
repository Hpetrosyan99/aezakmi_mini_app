# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information

Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes

Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies

Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback

Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions

Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries

Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions

Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations

Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code

Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits

Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks

Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates

Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links

Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation

Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

## End of File Newline

Always ensure files end with a newline character to comply with linting rules. Excluded json files

## Auto-Fix Issues with Dart CLI

After making changes, always run `dart fix --apply` to automatically fix issues that can be resolved by the Dart analyzer:
- Unused imports
- Unused elements
- Other auto-fixable lint issues

**Workflow:**
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `dart fix --apply` to auto-fix issues
3. If there are issues that cannot be auto-fixed, check them file by file
4. Run `dart analyze` to verify all issues are resolved

**Pre-commit Hook:**
The pre-commit hook automatically runs `dart fix --apply` before analysis, so most auto-fixable issues will be resolved automatically. However, you should still run it manually after making significant changes to catch issues early.
